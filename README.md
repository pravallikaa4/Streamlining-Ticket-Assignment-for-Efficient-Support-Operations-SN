Streamlining Ticket Assignment for Efficient Support Operations ServiceNow

This project introduces an organized and automated way to handle ticket assignment in ServiceNow.
It ensures that incoming issues are automatically directed to the correct teams, minimizing manual work and boosting resolution speed.

📋 Overview

Service requests are often delayed due to repetitive manual ticket assignments, which also increases the chances of errors.
To solve this, the project establishes a clear framework that:

Creates structured users, groups, and roles for managing access

Builds a custom table to log and monitor operational issues

Secures data with role-based ACLs

Leverages Flow Designer to automate ticket routing

🎯 Objectives

Define a proper user, group, and role hierarchy

Protect custom tables with security rules and ACLs

Route tickets automatically to the right groups

Improve efficiency by minimizing manual handling

✨ Key Components
🔹 Users, Groups, and Roles

Added unique users for testing and configuration

Organized users into groups for platform and certification tasks

Assigned roles aligned with responsibilities

Ensured proper mapping of users → groups → roles

🔹 Custom Table for Operational Issues

Designed a new table Operations Related to record issue details

Enabled Create module and mobile module for flexibility

Defined structured fields with predefined issue types:

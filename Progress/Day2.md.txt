Day 2 – Custom Table Setup and Access Restrictions

Objective:
Design a custom table to track operations-related issues, define its structure, and apply access control using roles and ACLs.

Work Completed:

Table Creation: Built a custom table under System Definition → Tables named Operations Related. Enabled both Create module and Create mobile module. Added fields to capture issue details.

Choice Field Setup: Using Form Design, added options for the Issue field:

Unable to log in to platform

404 error

Certificate-related queries

Expired user issue

Group Assignments:

Katherine Pierce assigned to Certificates Group (Certification_role).

Manne Niranjan assigned to Platform Group (Platform_role).

Access Restrictions: Configured table permissions so only Platform_role and Certification_role can perform read/write actions. Elevated to security_admin role for changes.

ACL Configuration: Defined new ACLs for table fields under System Security → Access Control. Linked admin role where required.

Evidence: Screenshots captured for table creation, form design, group mapping, and ACL setup.

Deliverables:

Exported Update Set including Operations Related table and related ACLs.

Stored screenshots in project folder.

Updated documentation with the configurations.
